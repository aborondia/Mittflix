# MittFlix - [Andrew Borondia](https://cranky-beaver-6bfa9c.netlify.app/projects)

This is a project I made as part of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of trades and Technology.

It is created with React.js and allows the user to search for movies in the TMDB API database. The user can add & remove movies to and from their watch list.
